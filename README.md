# INTRO\_AI\_Task\_1  
INTRO\_AI Task 1 (Group 2 - Team C)  

Functions to implement (ToDo):    
- [ ] hamming()  
- [ ] manhattan()  
- [ ] neighbors()  
- [ ] isSolvable()  
- [ ] calculateCosts()  
- [ ] generateRandomSolvableBoard()  
- [ ] runBenchmark()  
- [ ] use priority queue for open list (states yet to be explored, retrieve node with lowest
cost ùëì)  
- [ ] use set for closed list (states already been fully explored)  
- [ ] parent mapping (keep track of parent node to reconstruct the solution)  
- [ ] simple user interface
